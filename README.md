# File_Integrity_Verifier
This program will helps you verify the integrity of a file or ZIP archive by calculating and comparing hash values (MD5, SHA1, SHA256). Just select a file, view its checksums, and paste a reference hash to check if it matches. For ZIP files, it shows the hashes of each file inside.
